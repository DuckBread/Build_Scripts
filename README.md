# Build_Scripts
Scripts I use when building Android ROMs (will not provide support for these unless otherwise stated below)

## About the scripts
* **[Build-XOSP_N-Shamu.sh](https://github.com/DuckBread/Build_Scripts/blob/master/Build-XOSP_N-Shamu.sh) -** This is designed to be executed by Jenkins running on my home server. This way I can do (mostly) automated builds of XOSP. It *can* be used outside of Jenkins however, so if you just want to run it straight from your terminal, you may.
